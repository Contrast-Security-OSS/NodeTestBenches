# FastifyTestBench
Intentionally Vulnerable Fastify Application

## Running Locally

Make sure you have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) installed or install a version of node from [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Contrast-Security-OSS/FastifyTestBench.git # or clone your own fork
cd FastifyTestBench
npm install
npm start
```

Your app should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).

## Running with Contrast

### Installation
See [our documentation](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/installation-nodeinstall.html) for installation instructions.

### Running the agent
After installation, the agent can be run with ```npm run contrast```.
For more information on configuration and which technologies the agent supports, see our [documentation](https://docs.contrastsecurity.com/installation-node.html#node-config).

## Adding a shared vulnerability
Once you have added shared functionality to
[`@contrast/test-bench-utils`](https://github.com/Contrast-Security-OSS/test-bench-utils)
and
[`@contrast/test-bench-content`](https://github.com/Contrast-Security-OSS/test-bench-content),
you are ready to add an endpoint in the test bench application.

Create a _routes/ruleName.js_ file and call the `controllerFactory` method:
```js
const controllerFactory = require('../../utils/controllerFactory');
module.exports = controllerFactory('ruleName');
```

Check the documentation for `controllerFactory` under _utils/controllerFactory.js_
usage information.

Add a _view/ruleName.ejs_ file that includes the shared
template from `@contrast/test-bench-content`:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <% include ./partials/head %>
  </head>
  <body>
    <% include ./partials/header %>
    <div class="container-fluid">
      <div class="row">
        <% include ./partials/nav %>
        <div class="col-sm-9 col-sm-offset-3 col-md-10 col-md-offset-2 main">
          <% include ../node_modules/@contrast/test-bench-content/views/ruleName.ejs %>
          <% include ./partials/footer %>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>

```

Now run the app and make sure everything works as expected!
